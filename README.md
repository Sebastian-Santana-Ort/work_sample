# Purpose

I set up this small GitHub repository to share samples of my work in R (both script and markdown), Python, SPSS, and PowerBI. I have also used SAS (including using pros SQL to manage queries) and Tableau, but I have only used them in a government setting so I cannot share those projects freely.

I would be more than happy to share more of my work if needed. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Sebastian
